	<h1>Welcome to the PowerPC realm</h1>
	<p>The PowerPC Realm is a small hobby website run by me, Quin. &nbsp;It helps to keep the classic web alive.
	<br>I believe that the web in its modern form is a far cry from what it was meant to be, and so I have designed this 
	site with the sole aim of sharing information, and with the hardware of yesteryear in mind.</p>
	
	
	<div class="box">
	
		<h3>The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can
		communicate through sharing information.</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web.</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<p>This website should work well on PowerPC macs, as it doesn't try to load any weird scripts, track you, or download heaps of un-optimised assets.
	I will gradually update it with useful information, short tutorials, links to resources, and videos. &nbsp;Enjoy your stay!
