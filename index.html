	<h1>Welcome to the PowerPC realm</h1>
	<h3 style="color:red;">**  THIS SITE IS HEAVILY UNDER CONSTRUCTION, LOTS OF THINGS WON'T WORK YET **</h3><br>
	<p>The PowerPC Realm is a small hobby website run by me, Quin. &nbsp;It helps to keep the classic web alive.
	<br>I believe that the web in its modern form is a far cry from what it was meant to be, and so I have designed this 
	site with the sole aim of sharing information, and with the hardware of yesteryear in mind.</p>
	
	
	<div class="box">
	
		<h3>The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can
		communicate through sharing information.</h3>

	<p>This website should work well on PowerPC macs, as it doesn't try to load any weird scripts, track you, or download heaps of un-optimised assets.
	I will gradually update it with useful information, short tutorials, links to resources, and videos. &nbsp;Enjoy your stay!

	<h1>About PowerPC macs</h1>
	<p>As you will know, one of Apple's advantages is that they design both the software and the hardware of their product, allowing them to precisely coordinate any changes and transitions.
	&nbsp;Since its introduction on the 24th January 1984, the macintosh personal computer has gone through many.<br><br>
	One of these transitions that took place in the early 90s, was the shift away from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000">Motorola 68k</a> processors, in favour of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC">PowerPC</a>.<br>
	This change paved the way for many new and revolutionary technologies, including the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Macintosh_models_grouped_by_CPU_type#PowerPC_601">32-bit for the first time</a> on a mac.<br>
	<br>The PowerPC CPU families served Apple's mac products from 1994 to 2006, during which time I believe the mac really found its way.<br>Many of the features and technologies that we enjoy on our macs and iOS devices today were developed at this time.
	<br><br>Nowadays, PowerPC based macs are obsolete collectors items, but many of these machines still have life in them yet.<br>It's for this reason that I wanted to create this website; to share and enjoy the wonderful, albeit outdated world of PowerPC.</p>

		<h3>Motorola 68K ---> PowerPC ---> Intel ---> ARM</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Apple's CPU architecture transitions.</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<p>Well, yes!<br>Apple is currently in the process of switching away from Intel CPUs to ARM-based chips, similar to what has been used in iOS devices for years now.<br>As with all of these transitions, the <a href="https://www.alphr.com/features/390064/arm-vs-intel-processors-what-s-the-difference/">reasons</a> for doing so include lower power consumption/heat output, and much better performance with each change.</p>
